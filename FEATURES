This file contains some features that I intend to incorporate into this looper.

Support for:
 - Video looping.
	(What formats?)
 - Audio looping.
	(What formats?)

Features:
 - Slow-mo and Fast-mo.
 - Reverse direction?
 - Idle time between loops.
 - Specify frame length.
 - Buttons for frame shift length and direction.  Like the following:
     <<<<   <<<   <<  <   >  >>   >>>   >>>>

 - Play, Pause, and Stop.  Scroll-bar type of thing to go to a certain point.
 - Display currently playing time.
 - Save looping frame.
 - Save audio/video from looping frame.

Ideas, thoughts, planning:



lineedit - file            load button filedialog browse
(or from cmdline)

lineedit - mplayer loc.    button filedialog browse
lineedit - extra flags

-framedrop ?
-frames <number>  play only the first x frames, then quit

(AVI, with mp3 too?)
-idx / -forceidx  Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, al- lowing seeking. 
-saveidx
-loadix <index file>

-speed <0.01-100>
-sb <byte position>
-ss <time>  seek to a given time position.


linedit - cmd-to-execute<read-only>


up/down increase/decrease speed    qslider  <RESET to 100% BUTTON>
(speed)
lineedit value


shift- left/right - shift playback frame  qslider <RESET to start BUTTON>
(start time).
lineedit value


left-right for increase/decrease frame size qslider  ( start-time stays stationary )
(# seconds)
lineedit value  <RESET to 5 seconds> <Disable Looping>




<START>        <STOP>             <APPLY/SAVE>   <ABOUT>    <EXIT> 

exit should ask if changes should be saved.


Doing the following:
ffmpeg -i avi/mpeg/mp3
will cause the "Duration" to be printed out to stderr.
